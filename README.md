# Sample REST product service

Sample REST service for SAP Cloud Platform, created during this year's #sitMUC event in Munich.

Does not really do anything, than showing three sample products upon a `GET` request to `/test-api/products`

Based on Spring-Boot, but not as standalone application. Needs a Tomcat8.
